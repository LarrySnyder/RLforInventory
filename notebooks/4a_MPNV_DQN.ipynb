Recall that this problem can be solved analytically; the optimal policy is a base-stock policy with base-stock level 8 and expected cost $4.34$ per period. So a 100-period episode has an optimal reward of $-434$. My agent's reward of $-528$ is so-so. Of course we could improve it by more training, different hyperparameters, etc."
